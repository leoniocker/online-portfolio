        <p style="text-align: justify;">This was a project conducted in April 2016. The mission was to make and send 50 postcards for and of random people in Singapore.
        The project had several benefits as I got to learn more about Singapore and its citizens, but also learned more about myself.</p>

           </li>
          <li style="text-align: justify; color: white;">This project appeared after doing an intensive coaching training at the company "Executive Coach International". The Programme had an add-on programme called "Making Courage Work". Within this porject we had to give ourselves a project for the following 4 weeks that had to give some meaning to ourselves. I chose to create 50 postcards for 50 strangers in Singapore. That didn't just allow me to play around more with Photoshop and discover more places in Singapore, but I also had to overcome the fear of speaking to strangers on the street and getting their address, which, as a reward, they will receive a self-made postcard, made by me.</li>
